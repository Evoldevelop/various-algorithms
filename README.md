# Various Algorithms
This project has been created with the intention of gathering multiple algorithms into
one unique project in order to play with them.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java 17
* Maven 4.0.0
* IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3.2 (Community Edition)

## Setup
To run this project, follow the next steps:
1. ./mvnw compile
2. ./mvnw package
3. java -jar target/various-algorithms-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

## Use instructions
1. Run it and enjoy.
2. Type "quit" to terminate the program.

Apart from this "game", there is also different executable
algorithms like sorting algorithms.
## Observations
For this project, I did not keep in mind producing a good code
apart from the algorithms code. Interface implementations could be done, but
I was interested in use Java Reflection API as I did in AlgorithmService or in
Main. Moreover, project package structure was not keep in mind neither. The 
main question of this project is the algorithms.
