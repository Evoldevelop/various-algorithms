/**
 * <h1>ShellSort</h1>
 * Shell sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort, we
 * move elements only one position ahead. When an element has to be moved far
 * ahead, many movements are involved. The idea of ShellSort is to allow the
 * exchange of far items. In Shell sort, we make the array h-sorted for a large
 * value of h. We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is
 * said to be h-sorted if all sublists of every hâ€™th element are sorted.
